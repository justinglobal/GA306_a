### Coding Exercise - Noise Car

1. Open a New Scene in Maya and load polynoise.py and create_car.py into your workspace in their own tabs.

1. In a new tab, combine and adapt polynoise.py and create_car.py into a new .py file that applies the polynoise transformation to the 5 polygons when making a 'car' using the create_car.py file.

1. Note: Your final .py file should make a 'noise car' when run, and will need all the functions from both polynoise.py and create_car.py to work correctly.

1. Save file as 'noise_car.py', upload to github, then send link to the github file to instructor via slack

1. Hint: First, understand the basics of what each function does - **look at the inputs via function argument and outputs via return value**, then edit the functions from create_car.py to use the proper function from polynoise.py to apply the transformation. -->
