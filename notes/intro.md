Evacuation Procedures
Please proceed to the nearest exit when the strobe lights flash. If you hear an audible alarm, follow the instructions.

Brewery Blocks: Evacuation location is around the corner on 10th between Everett and Davis; do not stand in front of the Armory or Deschutes Brewery

Park Blocks: The evacuation location is the large metal elephant located just west of the Culinary/Industrial Design buildings within the North Park Blocks between NW Park Ave. and NW 8th Ave.

Someone will come and inform you when it is safe to come back into the building.  **ALWAYS ASSUME ANY EVACUATION IS REAL**

### Lab Policy
Leave food and drink outside the classroom. Disciplinary action will be taken toward any student found using the equipment in an inappropriate manner, taking cell phone calls or surfing the web. Disruptive, disrespectful or rude behavior will not be tolerated.

### Plagiarism
“Plagiarism, presenting the writings, images or paraphrased ideas of another as one’s own, is strictly prohibited at The Art Institute of Portland. Properly documented excerpts from others’ works, when they are limited to an appropriate amount of the total length of a student’s paper, are permissible when used to support a researched argument.”   

### Attendance Policy for the Art Institute of Portland
Students who are absent from all scheduled classes over a 14-day period (2 weeks) are subject to automatic attendance suspension—from the Institute, not just from this course. This means the student is administratively withdrawn from all courses and cannot attend classes or continue in the current quarter unless he/she successfully appeals for reinstatement. Students who anticipate violating the attendance policy should contact their Academic Advisor or Academic Department Director immediately to discuss options such as withdrawing from the Institute or navigating the appeals process.

### Adding, Dropping and Withdrawing from courses
Schedule Adjustment period: The schedule adjustment period runs through the first week of the quarter (ending at 5 pm on Monday of Week 2). To add or drop a course, the student must complete a schedule adjustment form, available from the Registrar’s Office or in Academic Affairs. The signature of the student’s academic advisor is required to make any changes to the student’s schedule.

Withdrawal (W/WF):  The student who withdraws from a course or from the program during the first nine weeks of the quarter will be assigned a “W” code for each course. The “W” code is not used in computation of the student’s grade point average; however, “W” credits are counted toward total credits attempted. The student who withdraws from a course or from the program after the ninth week of the quarter will be assigned a “WF” code for each course. The “WF” code is the equivalent of a grade of “F” and is used in computing the student’s grade point average. Students wishing to completely withdraw from The Art Institute of Portland must file an official Status Change Form with the Registrar.

### Absences Policy
Regular attendance is required for successful completion of this course. A student who misses the equivalent of three (3) classes will be withdrawn from the class. Exceptions for extenuating circumstances will be considered at the discretion of the instructor, who must notify the Associate Dean and Registrar’s Office of any such exceptions.
