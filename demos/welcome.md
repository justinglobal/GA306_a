### Welcome to Class!

GA306 - Scripting for 3D tools with 🐍Python🐍

Open web browser, Brackets, Maya, and Terminal

All class info/assignments here: https://github.com/justinglobal/GA306_a


<!-- 🐍Week 10 is here!🐍

1. clone your ga306 github folder onto your desktop

1. download the "spike.py" file from class github here: https://github.com/justinglobal/GA306_a/tree/master/demos/ch4
or go to "Chapter 4 Resources" on main gethub page

1. complete any homework not turned in yet

1. define chapter 4 terms [(found here)](/notes/terms.md)

1. work on final project -->

<!-- GA-306 Week 9

🐍Functions with Arguments!🐍

Write a function that creates a cube, a sphere, and a cylinder. Use default
arguments to make the default value for the diameter of the sphere and Cylinder
and the dimensions of the cube to be 4.

Hint: write the code to make the objects first, then wrap them in a function
with default arguments.

Bonus: Make your function able to make all the standard shapes by default
with a 'width' of 4, with an argument that allows the user to specify the
number of each object to create. Ex: using this function, a user could create
2 spheres, 1 cube, and 5 cylinders by changing the default argument. -->

<!-- GA306 - Week 8
Terms quiz today!

🐍For loop fun🐍

Write a function that takes in a list of strings and appends ".function"
and a number counting up from 1 for each item in the list and prints each
item as it iterates.

So, if your list was like this example:

your_list = ['left-arm', 'right-arm', 'left-leg', 'right-leg']

your function would produce an output something like:

left-arm.function1
right-arm.function2
left-leg.function3
right-leg.function4

and also print the entire new list.

Save file as "loopfun.py" and send to instructor via slack.

Bonus: use the "enumerate" function in your answer. -->

<!-- GA306 - Week 7

🐍 Write me a function 🐍

Using your own asset in Maya, write a function that selects and transforms objects
in your scene.

Any transformation is fine, including things like its name, color, etc.

If you do not have an asset you'd like to work on, create some basic shapes and
connect their rotation and translation attributes in a novel way.

The goal is to do a quick bit of programming to get you back into the right
head-space for class. -->

<!-- GA306 Week 5

Write a script that creates a sphere and a cube. Then connect the translation of the sphere to the rotation of the cube.

Save your script as rotate.py and send to instructor via slack.

Hint: Use the connectAttr() function described on p. 42 of your text. -->

<!-- GA306 Week 4

Write a program that uses a For Loop to print your name plus the following string: " awesome"

Your output should use **your name** but look like this:

j awesome
u awesome
s awesome
t awesome
i awesome
n awesome

Save your file as "awesome.py" and send to instructor via slack. -->

<!-- GA-306 Week 3

Opening exercise 1: Write a Python script to make a cube 6x6x6 units. Save script as "week2opener.py" and send to me via slack.

Opening exercise 2: Do the practice "Volume Converter" on the main class GitHub.

Justin and Jake: Do the "Wall Painting" Exercise

Send file to me via slack. -->
